# COMP551-Applied-ML
* **Project 1:** Implemention from scratch of the Naives Bayes and Logistic Regression models complete with data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning

* **Project 2:** Experimenting with SVM, AdaBoost, Random Forests, and more ML models using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) as well as Tf-Idf vectorization and NLP preprocessing techniques

* **Project 3:** Implementation of different CNN architectures using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) for image classification. Experimenting with regularization and optimization techniques for deep learning models (dropout, batch normalization, ZCA whitening, etc.)
